# Why this website exists

This is not your usual designer portfolio. I'm not mainly interested in showingcase my work — at least not for now. I guess only time will tell. I've always wanted a place to write small thoughts and ideas. Maybe tutorials and guides on subjects that are (most likely) unpopular. Above everything else, this is my personal playground. A place where I can try coding-related stuff, where I can try new text formats and just have some fun.

A lot of details are still being ironed out. Keep in mind I'm coding everything myself as I learn so progress is sometimes slow — and almost always, painful.

## Kown bugs

There are definitely bugs and undesired behaviors. This is a non exaustive list of things that require attention and fix. If you find something else that is not listed below, please do let me know.

## To do

Incremental progress is how I'm tackling this challenge. So there will always be something to do. An animation to polish, a better code to write, a new technology to try. So far, this is what I'm planning to do next, in no particular order.

- Implement `BEM` methodology
- Create a `highlight` class for adding a highlight element to text paragraphs
- Ensure mobile responsiveness using `clamp()` and similar functions
- Standardize motion tokens by reviewing and refining all animations
- Design a styling for quotes
- Append a `Home` link at the end of each article along with a random 'Read more' suggestion
- Incorporate Smooth Scroll (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5yvDlH7X9A)
- Correct the y-position of the title in `[slug].js`

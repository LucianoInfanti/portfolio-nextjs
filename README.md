# Why this website exists

This is not your usual designer portfolio. I'm not mainly interested in showingcase my work — at least not for now. I guess only time will tell. I've always wanted a place to write small thoughts and ideas. Maybe tutorials and guides on subjects that are (most likely) unpopular. Above everything else, this is my personal playground. A place where I can try coding-related stuff, where I can try new text formats and just have some fun.

A lot of details are still being ironed out. Keep in mind I'm coding everything myself as I learn so progress is sometimes slow — and almost always, painful.

## Kown bugs

There are definitely bugs and undesired behaviors. This is a non exaustive list of things that require attention and fix. If you find something else that is not listed below, please do let me know.

## To do

Incremental progress is how I'm tackling this challenge. So there will always be something to do. An animation to polish, a better code to write, a new technology to try. So far, this is what I'm planning to do next, in no particular order.

- Implement `BEM`
- Add a `highlight` class that creates a highlight element for text paragraphs
- Mobile & responsiviness with `clamp()` and similar functions
- Take a pass at all animations and standardize motion tokens
- Add a quote styling
- Add a `Home` link to the end of every article and a randomized 'Read more'
- Add Smoth Scroll (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5yvDlH7X9A)
- Add a smooth fade in for every `<p>` elements within `[slug].tsx`. Refer to previous project
